# Turtle-Draw
This Python program uses the turtle graphics library to draw shapes like squares, triangles, and rectangles based on user input. It defines functions for each shape and uses a loop to prompt the user. Based on the input, the selected shape is drawn. The turtle window stays open until clicked, making it a fun beginner-friendly graphics project.

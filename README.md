This Python program uses the turtle graphics library to interactively draw geometric shapes like squares, triangles, and rectangles based on user input. The program begins by creating a turtle object named timmy, customized with a turtle shape and red color. Several functions are defined to draw individual shapes:

square(): Draws a square with four equal sides using a loop.

triangle(): Draws a triangle roof by connecting three points.

rectangle(): Draws a rectangle by alternating between two side lengths.

hide(): Hides the turtle cursor after drawing.

A while-loop prompts the user to input which shape to draw. Based on the input, the corresponding shape-drawing function is called. If the user enters an invalid shape name, the loop ends after showing a message.

The turtle window (Screen) is then displayed and waits for the user to click to close it. The canvas height is also printed for reference.

This program is a beginner-friendly exercise for learning Python functions, conditional statements, loops, and graphical programming using the turtle module. It promotes interactive coding and visual output, helping learners understand shape construction and coordinate systems.
